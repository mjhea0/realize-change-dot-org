**Mike** - When I'm at the pearly gates, This'll be on my videotape, My videotape, My videotape

**John** - When Mephistopheles is just beneath, And he's reaching up to grab me

**David** - This is one for the good days, And I have it all here, In red blue green, In red blue green

**Mike** - You are my center when I spin away, Out of control on videotape, On videotape, On videotape, On videotape, On videotape, On videotape, On videotape 

**Mike** - I gave an old woman my hat on the bus on a day it was negative five degrees outside.

**John** - This is my way of saying goodbye, Because I can't do it face to face, So I'm talking to you before it's too late

**Joanne** - No matter what happens now, I shouldn't be afraid, Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen.
